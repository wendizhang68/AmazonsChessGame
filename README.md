# AmazonsChessGame
The game of Amazons is a simple but rather interesting board game, usually for two players. It was invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina, and originally called El Juego de las Amazonas (now a trademark of Ediciones de Mente). The board is a 10 by 10 chessboard. Each player gets four "amazons" (represented as chess queens), white for the player who moves first, and black for the opponent.
